# npm_package_starter
## Update 1 - 11 Feb 2023
Hello, guys. I am just starting to develop npm packages as a side hustle now and I am starting from the bottom - knowing nothing about how to create them :D
This starter was created, based on this [article](https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c) in [itnext.io](https://itnext.io)
As I get better and publish some of my own packages, i will update this starter with new original content and good practices that i learn on my journey. Every major update will be mentioned here in this .md
Good luck to me.
